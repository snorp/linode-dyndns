Usage:
linode-dyndns -k [api_key] -d [domain_id] -r [resource_id]

You can get the domain and resource ids from Linode's edit page for
the DNS entry you want to modify. They're found in the URL for that
page.

By default, this sets the resource's IP address to your public facing
address. You can override that behavior with the --address option.
